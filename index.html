        <div id="what"><hr>
        <br>Our proposal is to make Earth a better place to live where everyone can have access to all the facilities.<br>
        <br> For this, apart from our aeronautical work we are carrying out industrial evolution projects in the most disadvantaged territories so that they are not left behind either.<br>               <br>But we go further, we want to revolutionize the aeronautical world because, as Albert Einstein said, "The important thing is not to stop asking questions," and in this way, this new idea emerged.

        <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
        <h2>The solution</h2>
         <div id="what"><hr>
        <p>We are a group of engineers with experience in large aviation companies such as Lockheed Martin, Airbus or Dassault.</p><p> In these companies we have gathered the experience and knowledge necessary to develop what was our objective from the first moment, the construction of the most efficient aircraft in the world. </p><hr></div>

        <h3>Future Aviation</h3>
        <p>Aviation is changing and we are going to use our resources and our years of experience to be part of this change. What we want is to be at the forefront of the sector.</p><p> Always with the latest innovations trying to make more effective and useful mechanisms and leaving them at the service of society to achieve sustainable progress.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New materials we are working on.</li>
            <li>Better security systems.</li>
            <li>Performance harnessed from the energy the aircraft accumulates.</li>
            
        </ul></div>

        <h3>Actual Aviation</h3>
        <p>Technologies' development, as well as the dsicovery of new materials has led to incredibble and innovative milestone in aviation.</p>
       <p>An example of this can be the modern fighter jets that can reach a speed of Mach 3 and that are able to cool the system with their own fuel, by moving it through the jet.</p>
        <p>Another great example, in civilian aviation, has been the ability to transport with plans that are based on the stability.Some of the characerictics are</p> 
         <ul>
            <li>Aliminium and carbon composition.</li>
            <li>Diferent types of propelling.</li>
            <li>Able to speed up in a vertical climb.</li>
            
        </ul></div>
        
        <div id="historic"> 
        <h3>Hisorical Aviation</h3>
        <p>In the past, planes were not conceived as a method of transportation, nor a a means of scientific discovery.</p><p> But not because they didn't want, but because the industrial advances were not like now; although the left an open path for us. The most important characteristics at that time were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wood and fabric wings.</li>
            <li>Not aerodynamical bases.</li>
            <li>Less powerfull propellers.</li>
            <li>They discover the initial mechanics of flying.</li>
