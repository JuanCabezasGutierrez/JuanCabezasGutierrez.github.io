        <h1>WHAT IS DR. AIR?</h1>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        
        <div id="what"><hr>
        <br>Our proposal is to make Earth a better place to live where everyone can have access to all the facilities.<br>
        <br> For this, apart from our aeronautical work we are carrying out industrial evolution projects in the most disadvantaged territories so that they are not left behind either.<br>               <br>But we go further, we want to revolutionize the aeronautical world because, as Albert Einstein said, "The important thing is not to stop asking questions," and in this way, this new idea emerged.
        <br>

        <h1>WHO IS FORMED BY?</h1>
        <h2>Professionals</h2>
         <div id="what"><hr>
        <p>We are a group of engineers and product developers with experience in large aviation companies such as Lockheed Martin, Airbus or Dassault with a common porpose in all of our  minds.</p><p> In these companies we have gathered the experience and knowledge necessary to develop what was our objective from the first moment, the construction of the most efficient aircraft in the world. </p><hr></div>    
    
    <h4>AVIATION...AND ALL ITS FIELDS</h4>
    
        <div id="future">
        <h3>DRONES</h3>
        <p>Aviation is changing and we are going to use our resources and our years of experience to be part of this change. What we want is to be at the forefront of the sector.</p><p> Always with the latest innovations trying to make more effective and useful mechanisms and leaving them at the service of society to achieve sustainable progress.</p><p>The basis for the change:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New materials.</li>
            <li>Better security systems.</li>
            <li>Performance harnessed from the energy the aircraft accumulates.</li>
            
        </ul></div>
        
        <div id="historical">
       <h3>HELICOPTERS</h3>
        <p>In the past, planes were not conceived as a method of transportation, nor a a means of scientific discovery.</p><p> But not because they didn't want, but because the industrial advances were not like now; although the left an open path for us.</p><p>n the past, basic knowledge evolved in an amazing way with the transcurrence of the two world wars, in which aviation had its greatest stage of development.</p><p>Important characteristics at that time were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wood and fabric wings.</li>
            <li>Not aerodynamical bases.</li>
            <li>Less powerfull propellers.</li>
            <li>They discover the initial mechanics of flying.</li>
        </ul></div>
        
        <div id="actual"> 
            <h3>PLANES AND JETS</h3>
        <p>Technologies' development, as well as the dsicovery of new materials has led to incredibble and innovative milestone in aviation.</p>
       <p>An example of this can be the modern fighter jets that can reach a speed of Mach 3 and that are able to cool the system with their own fuel, by moving it through the jet.</p>
        <p>Another great example, in civilian aviation, has been the ability to transport with planes that are based on the stability.</p><p>Actual characteristics:</p> 
         <ul>
            <li>Aliminium and carbon composition.</li>
            <li>Diferent types of propelling.</li>
            <li>Able to speed up in a vertical climb.</li>
            
        </ul> </div>
